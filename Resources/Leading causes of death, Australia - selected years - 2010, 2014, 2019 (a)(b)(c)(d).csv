"a. Causes listed are the top 20 leading causes of death for 2019, based on the WHO recommended tabulation of leading causes. See Mortality tabulations and methodologies for further information. . Groupings of deaths coded to Chapter XVIII: Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified (R00-R99) are not included in analysis, due to the unspecified nature of these causes. Furthermore, many deaths coded to this chapter are likely to be affected by revisions, and hence recoded to more specific causes of death as they progress through the revisions process."
"b. See the Data quality section of the methodology for further information on specific issues related to interpreting time-series and 2019 data."
"c. All causes of death data from 2006 onward are subject to a revisions process - once data for a reference year are 'final', they are no longer revised. Affected data in this table are: 2010 and 2014 (final) and 2019 (preliminary). See the Data quality section of the methodology and Causes of Death Revisions, 2016 Final Data (Technical Note) and 2017 Revised Data (Technical Note) in Causes of Death, Australia, 2018 (cat. no. 3303.0)."
"d. Changes in coding processes have been applied to 2019 data. See the Classifications and Mortality coding sections of the methodology for further information."
"e. The data presented for Malignant neoplasm of the colon, sigmoid, rectum and anus (C18-C21) includes deaths due to Malignant neoplasm of the intestinal tract, part unspecified (C26.0). Comparisons with data for this leading cause, and associated leading cause rankings, should therefore be made with caution. See Mortality tabulations and methodologies, Leading causes of death in the methodology section of this publication for further details."
"f. The data presented for intentional self-harm includes ICD-10 codes X60-X84 and Y87.0. Care needs to be taken in interpreting figures relating to intentional self-harm. See the Deaths due to intentional self-harm (suicide) section of the methodology in this publication."
"g. Care needs to be taken when interpreting data derived from Victorian coroner-referred deaths including suicide. See Technical note: Victorian additional registrations and time series adjustments for detailed information on this issue."
