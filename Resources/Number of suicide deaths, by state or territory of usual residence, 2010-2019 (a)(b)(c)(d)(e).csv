"a. All causes of death data from 2006 onward are subject to a revisions process - once data for a reference year are 'final', they are no longer revised. Affected data in this table are: 2010 - 2016 (final), 2017 (revised), 2018 and 2019 (preliminary). See the Data quality section of the methodology and Causes of Death Revisions, 2016 Final Data (Technical Note) and 2017 Revised Data (Technical Note) in Causes of Death, Australia, 2018 (cat. no. 3303.0)."
"b. The data presented for intentional self-harm includes ICD-10 codes X60-X84 and Y87.0. Care needs to be taken in interpreting figures relating to intentional self-harm. See the Deaths due to intentional self-harm (suicide) section of the methodology in this publication."
"c. See the Data quality section of the methodology for further information on specific issues related to interpreting time-series and 2019 data"
"d. Care needs to be taken when interpreting data derived from Victorian coroner-referred deaths including suicide. See Technical note: Victorian additional registrations and time series adjustments for detailed information on this issue."
"e. Changes in coding processes have been applied to 2019 data. See the Classifications and Mortality coding sections of the methodology for further information."
