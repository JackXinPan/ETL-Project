"a. Diabetes includes all deaths where the underlying cause of death is assigned an ICD-10 code between E10-E14."
"b. This graph only includes doctor certified deaths."
"c. This graph is compiled by the date the death occurred."
"d. This data is considered to be provisional and subject to change as additional data is received."
"e. In line with the ISO (International Organization for Standardisation) week date system, weeks are defined as seven-day periods which start on a Monday. Week 1 of any given year is the week which starts on the Monday closest to 1 January, and for which the majority of its days fall in January (i.e. four days or more). Week 1 therefore always contains the 4th of January and always contains the first Thursday of the year. Using the ISO structure, some years (e.g. 2015 and 2020) contain 53 weeks."
"f. Refer to the explanatory notes on the Methodology page of this publication for more information regarding the data in this graph."
